DigitalOcean Manager
=============

Implementation of the DigitalOcean API as Chrome Packaged App.

## Requirements  
- Node.js (NPM)
- Bower
- Grunt

Whole app is written using server-side JS (Angular.js), however Node.js (Grunt) comes handy for the development (minification, concatenation, packaging etc.).

## Installation
Install npm dependencies (this is only for development):
```
npm install
```

Install bower dependencies (client-side):
```
bower install
```
You are ready to go!

## Develop / Debug
Use Grunt to develop application (with live-reload):
```
grunt debug
```

## Packaging
Use Grunt to create release package:
```
grunt build
```

## Testing
Coming soon.
